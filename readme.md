# How to set up a BrAPI data warehouse?

In this repo you can find a way to quickly set up a Zendro instance using the BrAPI schema V2.1.


## Ready to use BrAPI-Zendro instance
In `brapi_with_models` folder you can find a ready to use Zendro instance using the latest schema of BrAPI. For this, we used a converter to translate BrAPI JSON model schemas to Zendro models. For details please see the next section.

Please follow the steps in [readme file](https://github.com/Zendro-dev/brapi_data_warehouse/tree/main/brapi_with_models) to set up the instance.
